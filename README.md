# Welcome to **Developer OCS**
An interactive, open source web application for developers to post, find and collaborate on portfolio-grade projects. This is a resource for developers of all skill levels: students, graduates (bootcamp or university), self-taught or anywhere in between. It's also an open bulletin for companies to have pilot projects built or try out new technologies while finding skilled resources dedicated to their craft who are looking to work on real-world applications.
